This is a very basic concept of a snake game in the console using C++. This project like all my others were not my own unique idea as this was all done purely as a learing attempt. 

# How the game works?

# Controls

simple controls such as WASD 
W - up 
A - right 
S - down 
D - left 

# What the game looks like
